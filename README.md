## Mass Mailer Attack

Mass Mailer attack is a type of social engineering attack. Large number of
spam mails are sent to different harvested e-mail addresses usually containing
malicious links/scripts. The attack is also used to send a large number of
spam e-mails to a single e-mail address possibly trying to crash the inbox.
Even if the attack doesnt crash the inbox service of a user it does fill the
inbox of a user to an extent that it is difficult for him/her to access important
emails. It is also called E-Bombing or SMS Attack.
